Mars Distance Travelled Analysis

To calculate the distance travelled by Mars when observed from Earth over a specified time range using NASA's WebGeoCalc tool and SPICE kernels.

This project utilizes the **Distance Finder** tool in WebGeoCalc to calculate the total distance Mars travelled relative to Earth within a specific time range. The calculation is based on SPICE kernel data, ensuring precise and accurate ephemeris data for Mars and Earth.


1. Kernels Selected
- **Ground Stations Kernels
- **Solar System Kernels (`v0059.tm`)
- **Latest Leap Seconds Kernel(`v0004.tm`)
- **SPICE Class - Mars Express Geometric Event Finding Lesson Kernels

2. Target and Observer**
